## What the Project Involved
As part of our CS3338 Software Engineering Tools course, we were required to:
- Select a prior senior design project (via [Ascent](https://ascent.cysun.org/project/project)) and simulate our own implementation
- Plan and build in four milestone-based **snapshots**, each adding functionality or documentation
- Use **GitHub**, **Docker**, **Jira**, and **TestRail** to manage the project lifecycle
- Submit full project documentation including:
  - **SDD** (Software Design Document)
  - **SRS** (Software Requirements Specification)
  - **User Manual**
  - **Snapshot Objectives**
  - **Design Spec**
  - **TestRail Documents**
  - **WorkFlow Diagram**
- Store all documents as `.tex` files for submission
